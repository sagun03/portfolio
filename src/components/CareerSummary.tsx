        Hey there! I’m <strong>Nisha Rani</strong>, AI Product Manager in the making with a knack for turning ideas into reality.
        I started my journey in logistics, where I mastered the art of problem-solving on the fly, because if you can handle supply chain surprises, you can handle anything! Now, I’m diving headfirst into tech and AI, crafting seamless user experiences and building products that actually make life easier.
        <br />
        <br />
        I love reading books and I’m obsessed with historical architecture like castles, cathedrals, and timeless designs. The way these structures stand the test of time inspires my approach to building products that last and leave an impact. 
        <br />
        <br />
        TLDR – I build cool products, geek out over AI,or figuring out how to make tech more human. Let’s connect!
